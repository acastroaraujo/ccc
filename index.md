# ccc

The `ccc` package helps get information about rulings from the Colombian
Constitutional Court in a way that is convenient for quantitative
analysis.

You can install the current version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("acastroaraujo/ccc")
```

It provides two main things:

- Various convenient functions for searching and downloading rulings
  directly from the [CCC
  website](https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/).

- Various built-in datasets ready for analysis.

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is:

``` R
@Manual{,
  title = {ccc: Colombian Constitutional Court data for use in R},
  author = {Andrés {Castro Araújo}},
  year = {2024},
  note = {R package version 0.1.0},
  url = {https://acastroaraujo.github.io/ccc/},
}
```
