## Thirty Years

`ccc` collects a corpus of over `r scales::comma(nrow(metadata))` rulings made by the Colombian Constitutional Court (CCC) which cover the period of 30 years immediately after the first ruling was published on April 3, 1992. All together, they form a complex citation network with approximately `r scales::comma(nrow(citations))` ties among them.

Each ruling has a standardized name (e.g., `C-776-03`, `T-025-04`, `SU-1184-01`). The prefix refers to the type of ruling; the infix carries no meaning; and the suffix indicates the year in which the ruling was made.

There are three types of ruling:

-   `C` refers to the cases in which the CCC decides whether a law, rule, administrative decision is compatible with constitutional norms—also known as *judicial review.*

-   `T` refers to *tutela*, which is an individual complaint mechanism (or special writ) aimed at the protection of fundamental rights. These *tutelas* give ordinary citizens the power to go before any ordinary judge and request the protection of their "fundamental constitutional rights" whenever they perceive them be threatened. Each year, the CCC selects approximately 2% of these cases for review, and the final decision may uphold or reverse decisions made by lower courts.

    A lot of these cases are related to healthcare access and pensions.

-   `SU` refers to decisions in which the Court has decided to compile several `T` cases. They are a sort of legally binding "Annual Reviews" for the judicial system in Colombia.

### Citations

`metadata` contains information on each ruling.

```{r}
metadata
```

`citations` contains the citation network in "edge list" format. Each citation has a `weight` that refers to the *number* of times a ruling cites a previous case.

```{r}
citations
```

There is also a convenient function that turns these two datasets into a squared adjacency matrix.

```{r}
M <- create_citation_adj_mat()
dim(M)
```

The resulting matrix $M$ is very sparse. It has `r scales::comma(prod(dim(M)))` cells and only `r scales::percent(mean(M > 0), accuracy = .001)` are non-zero.

The following figure is my best attempt at visualizing the whole thing:

![](figures/adj_mat_viz.png){width="75%"}

*Note. If we were to observe an empty column, it would mean that none of the rulings created during that particular time period where cited in future rulings (i.e., rulings that failed to become precedent). If we were to observe an empty row, it would mean that none of the rulings created during that particular time period cited previous rulings. Both of these scenarios are entirely hypothetical.*

### Time Traveling

A citation network $\mathbf M$ is always **directed, asymmetric**, and **acyclic**---i.e., it points backwards in time.

Let's assume that $\mathbf M$ is lower triangular, meaning that all elements above the main diagonal are zero. This happens when the documents are arranged from first to last, the rows represent source documents, and the columns represent target documents. The main diagonal is also zero because we won't allow any document to cite itself.

*Note. The direction of the citation can be considered backwards in time (i.e., documents citing past documents) or forwards in time (i.e., knowledge flowing from documents to future documents). Here I use a backward-looking convention. In acyclic temporal graphs of this sort, the in-degree of the earliest node is always zero and the out-degree of the newest node is also always zero.*

However, the CCC matrix is *not* lower triangular. Some documents cite each other in a way that creates the illusion of time travel because the court has been writing them simultaneously. In some (very few) cases a ruling will cite another one that will be published a couple months later.

Other rulings have been modified many years later for privacy concerns—e.g., `T-1003-99`. In such cases the CCC has modified the original to text to ensure that the names of the parties involved are rendered anonymous.

These sorts of modifications are usually prefaced by a small editorial note at the beginning of the document.

```{r}
url <- "https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/1999/T-1003-99.htm"
txt <- ccc_txt(url)

txt |> 
  stringr::str_trunc(width = 300) |> 
  stringr::str_squish() |> 
  stringr::str_wrap() |> 
  cat()
```

This document is also accompanied by a small text—labeled *Auto 397/19***—**which contains citations to future rulings that deal with the issue of anonymity in public documents. There are more examples of this kind of time travel in the CCC dataset.

Thus, the upper triangular section of the $\mathbf M$ matrix for the Colombian Constitutional Court has various non-zero entries.

```{r}
sum(M[upper.tri(M)] > 0L)
```

### Text Features

The `docterms` dataset contains a data frame with document identifiers (`doc_id`) and word counts (`lemma` and `n`). It has `r scales::comma(nrow(docterms))` rows.

```{r}
docterms
```

This dataset contains `r scales::comma(length(unique(docterms$doc_id)))` unique documents with a vocabulary size of `r scales::comma(length(levels(docterms$lemma)))`.

The `create_dtm()` function creates a sparse document-term matrix from the information contained in `docterms`.

```{r}
A <- create_dtm()
dim(A)
```

Close to 91% of the cells in this matrix are empty, which is why we call it a "sparse matrix."

```{r}
mean(A == 0L)
```

Here is a random subset of $\mathbf{A}$:

```{r}
set.seed(1111)
i <- sample(1:nrow(A), 10)
j <- sample(1:ncol(A), 5)
A[i, j]
```

*Note. I am still unsatisfied with the Spanish lemmatization provided by spaCy, so this will probably change in the future if I figure out a better way.*

### Centrality

This section relies on some external packages.

```{r, message=FALSE}
## General Purpose

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

theme_set(
  theme_light(base_family = "Crimson Text") + 
  theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#4C4C4C"))
)

## Networks

library(igraph)
```

#### Citations Across Time

The following Figure shows average in-degree (citations) and out-degree (references) made in each ruling across the years. Note that, on average, the decisions written during 1992 tend to be significantly more cited that the ones written in other years, giving them some sort of "first-movers advantage" over the others---i.e., the most innovative thing of any kind is the first of its kind.

```{r}
metadata |> 
  pivot_longer(c(indegree, outdegree), names_to = "dtype", values_to = "degree") |> 
  mutate(dtype = case_when(
    dtype == "indegree" ~ "Average Inward Citations (in-degree)",
    dtype == "outdegree" ~ "Average Outward Citations (out-degree)"
  )) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, degree)) + 
  stat_summary(
    fun.data = \(x) mean_cl_boot(x, conf.int = 0.95), size = 1/3,#fatten = 1/2, size = 2,
    shape = 21, fill = "white", stroke = 1/2
  ) + 
  facet_grid(~dtype, scales = "free_y") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = seq(1992, 2022, 4), breaks = seq(1992, 2022, 4)) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
```

@fowler2008 interpret the panel on the right as evidence that the legal norm of *stare decisis,* but that's definitely wishful thinking. @leskovec2007 show that that out-degree tends to grow over time in many different kinds of networks.

The following Figure disaggregates both kinds of citation by *type of ruling.*

```{r}
metadata |> 
  pivot_longer(c(indegree, outdegree), names_to = "dtype", values_to = "degree") |> 
  mutate(dtype = case_when(
    dtype == "indegree" ~ "Average Inward Citations (in-degree)",
    dtype == "outdegree" ~ "Average Outward Citations (out-degree)"
  )) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, degree)) + 
  stat_summary(
    fun.data = \(x) mean_cl_boot(x, conf.int = 0.68), fatten = 1/2,
    shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 1/10
  ) + 
  facet_grid(type ~ dtype) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = seq(1992, 2022, 4), breaks = seq(1992, 2022, 4)) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
```

#### Hubs and Authorities

Instead focusing on in-degree or out-degree, we can follow @fowler2008 in calculating more sophisticated measures of centrality.

The key insight is that we can transform the original (unweighted) citation matrix in two different ways:

-   A **co-citation** matrix in which any two rulings are connected by the total number of other rulings that cite both. The `cocitation()` function in `igraph` makes the following calculation:

    $$
    \mathbf C = \mathbf{M}^\top \mathbf{M}
    $$

-   A **bibliographic coupling**, in which any two rulings are connected by the number of common references. The `bibcoupling()` function in `igraph` makes the following calculation:

    $$
    \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{MM}^\top
    $$

Here, the diagonal elements of $\mathbf{C}$ correspond to the in-degree for each ruling (or the row sums of $\mathbf{M}$); whereas the diagonal elements of $\mathbf{B}$ correspond to the out-degree for each ruling (or the column sums of $\mathbf{M}$).

Following @kleinberg1999, @fowler2008 calculate *authority* and *score* hubs for each ruling. These are the first eigenvectors of $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ respectively.

Ronald Breiger once noted that _"several stories might be, and are, told about eigenvectors. They are the low-dimensional scaffolds that support higher-dimensional structures."_ In this case, the story is supposed to go something like this:

> The authority score of a case depends on the number of times it is cited and the quality of the cases that cite it. Symmetrically, the hub score of a case depends on the number of cases it cites and the quality of the cases cited. Thus, authority scores indicate the degree to which a case is thought to be important for resolving other important issues that come before the Court, while hub scores indicate the degree to which a case is well-grounded in previous important rulings.
>
> @fowler2008 [pp. 17]

Calculating these scores is pretty straightforward using the `igraph` package:

```{r}
net <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(
  ## we will use the unweighted edge list
  d = citations |> select(!weight), 
  directed = TRUE, 
  vertices = metadata |> select(id, type, date, year, indegree, outdegree)
)

V(net)$authority <- igraph::authority_score(net, scale = FALSE)$vector
V(net)$hub <- igraph::hub_score(net, scale = FALSE)$vector
```

Measurements of authority are correlated with in-degree measurements, but they're not the same thing.

```{r}
igraph::as_data_frame(net, what = "vertices") |> 
  mutate(top = ifelse(rank(-authority) %in% 1:3, name, "")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(indegree, authority, color = type)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = top), size = 3, family = "Avenir")
```

The same goes for "hub" and "out-degree" measurements.

```{r}
igraph::as_data_frame(net, what = "vertices") |> 
  mutate(top = if_else(rank(-hub) %in% 1:4, name, "")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(outdegree, hub, color = type)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = top), size = 3, family = "Avenir")
```

*Note. It makes sense that SU rulings are heavily represented as "hubs."*

Finally, note that authority and hub scores are somewhat related to each other; however, by definition, the very first rulings can never be hubs and the very last rulings can never be authorities. Hence we see three clusters.

```{r}
igraph::as_data_frame(net, what = "vertices") |> 
  ggplot(aes(authority, hub, color = date)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/5) +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + scale_color_viridis_c(trans = "date")
```
