# ccc

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The `ccc` package helps get information from the Colombian Constitutional Court.

You can install the current version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("acastroaraujo/ccc")
```

It has the following functions:

- `ccc_search`
- `ccc_clean_data`
- `ccc_txt`
- `ccc_rtf`
- `extract_citations`

And the following datasets:

- `metadata`
- `citations`
- `docterms`

## Download

Use the `ccc_search()` function to lookup some cases.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ccc)
library(dplyr)

results <- ccc_search(
  text = "familia", 
  date_start = "1999-01-01", 
  date_end = "2001-12-31"
)

glimpse(results)
```

This data is a little messy. The `ccc_clean_dataset()` provides some useful tidying, but you might want to consider doing things differently.

```{r}
df <- ccc_clean_dataset(results)
glimpse(df)
```

Next you'll want to download some texts. You can use either `ccc_txt()` or `ccc_rtf()` (_Rich Text Format_) to do this.

I prefer `ccc_txt()` because most rtf files don't include footnotes.

```{r}
url <- sample(df$url, 1)

## download from the following url
url

txt <- ccc_txt(url)

txt |> 
  ## truncated output
  stringr::str_trunc(1e3) |> 
  cat()
```

Finally, you can `extract_citations()` easily as follows:

```{r}
extract_citations(txt)
```


## Data

There are 3 built-in datasets in this package, which cover 30 years after the first ruling was published.

```{r}
glimpse(citations)
```

```{r}
glimpse(metadata)
```

```{r}
glimpse(docterms)
```

To see the process whereby these datasets were created, you can follow the scripts [here](https://github.com/acastroaraujo/ccc_datos/tree/master/data-raw).

You can get a document-term matrix instead of `docterms` easily with the `create_dtm()` function. The result will be a very sparse matrix.

I recommend that you load the `Matrix` package if you're going to work with this object.

```{r}
library(Matrix)

M <- create_dtm()
dim(M)

mean(M == 0) ## sparsity
M[sample(nrow(M), 20), sample(ncol(M), 5)] ## random subset
```
